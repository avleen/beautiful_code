# Beautiful Code

Writing code, like many endeavours, is a trade off between Good, Fast and Cheap.

Beautiful code works around this by requiring that it be Good.
Good code is easy to understand, and achieves its goal in a most straightforward
manner.

This leaves us with deciding between Fast and Cheap, both of which we can make
reasoned decisions based on our other constraints.

This repository contains a collection of Beautiful code.
Each example is a trade off between being fast to write or use, or cheap to
implement. But it is always simple to step through and understand.

# Contributing

Beautiful code isn't written by one person in isolation. We write it together in
teams and communities across the internet, and your contributions are welcome
here.

Please help by contributing problems and how they can be solved in your language
of choice.
It can also be helpful to describe how basics like loops operate in your
language, if that hasn't been described, before you dive into problems.
This provides some grounding for people new to the language.

Code is organised under language-specific directories.
Each file should focus around a topic (loops, concurrency, sub-processes, etc).
Add comments and explanations of what your code is doing!
